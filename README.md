# Practice

Archive of tests, examples, and various simple codes I experiment with as I continue on my never-ending journey to improve my programming skills.


Things I could put in this repo that wouldn't necessarily belong in its own repo:

- Codes I've written while following along with tutorials and guides.
- Basic scripts in other languages; aka, the sorts of codes I've already written in other languages, but still would like to make in languages I'm learning as practice.
- Tests I've written for new commands and functions I'm playing around with, as I learn the nuances of certain languages and study them beyond what's found in the simple beginner tutorials.
- Projects I've done for school during courses I've taken as a physics major. This has included R (for statistics and probability), and Python (for data science).
