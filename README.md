# Practice

Archive of tests, examples, and various simple codes I experiment with as I continue on my never-ending journey to improve my programming skills. Most of these probably wouldn't be of much use to others, but I like having this repository anyways as a public tracker of my learning effort and progress.


Things I might put in this repository that wouldn't necessarily belong in their own repo:

- Codes I've written while following along with tutorials and guides.
- Basic test scripts in other languages; aka, the sorts of codes I've already written in other languages, but still would like to make in languages I'm learning as practice.
- Tests I've written for new commands and functions I'm playing around with, as I learn the nuances of certain languages and study them beyond what's found in the simple beginner tutorials.
- Projects I've done for school during courses I've taken throughout my physics degree. This has included R (for statistics and probability), and Python (for data science).
