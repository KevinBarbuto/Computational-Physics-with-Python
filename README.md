# Practice

Archive of tests, examples, and various simple codes I experiment with as I continue on my never-ending journey to improve my programming skills.


Things I could put in this repo that wouldn't necessarily belong in its own repo:

- Basic scripts in other languages; aka, the sorts of codes I've already written in other languages, but still would like to make in languages I'm learning as practice
-
